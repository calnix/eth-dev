### Boilerplate requirements

What is a boilerplate?

In computer programming, **boilerplate code** or **boilerplate** refers to sections of code that have to be included in many places with little or no alteration. It is often used when referring to languages that are considered _verbose_, i.e. the programmer must write a lot of code to do minimal jobs.

{% hint style="info" %}
For instance, a lawyer may give you a five page contract to sign, but most of the contract is boilerplate — meaning it’s the same for everyone who gets that contract, with only a few lines changed here and there.
{% endhint %}
