# Transaction costs & Execution costs

**Transaction costs** are based on the cost of sending data to the blockchain. There are 4 items which make up the full transaction cost:

1. the base cost of a transaction (21000 gas)
2. the cost of a contract deployment (32000 gas)
3. the cost for every **zero byte** of data or code for a transaction.
4. the cost of every non-zero byte of data or code for a transaction.

**Execution costs** are based on the cost of computational operations which are executed as a result of the transaction.

You can see the breakdown in the yellow paper, Appendix G.
