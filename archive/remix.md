# Remix

The Remix editor can compile the SC to an **in-browser** fake network for testing purposes.

Environment -> JavaScript VM  (London/Berlin)

> transactions will be executed in **a sandbox blockchain in the browser**. This means nothing will be persisted and a page reload will restart a new blockchain from scratch, the old one will not be saved.

When you click create on to deploy in remix, it will deploy an **instance** of the contract.

Each deployment is a separate instance.\
