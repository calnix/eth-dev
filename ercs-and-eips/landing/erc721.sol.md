### Why are there 2 functions named \_safeMint?

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (280).png>)

* You can have multiple functions with the same name, as long as their signature is not the same.&#x20;
* Function parameters are also part of the signature, so the function signature of these two functions are different. Hence, they do not get mixed up in any way.&#x20;
* Whenever you call a contract function, you have to provide the parameters as well. The executed function is chosen based on the name and provided parameters.
* The first function is just a shorthand version of the second hand, since it calls the second function.
  * it makes the "data" field optional by using overloading - if data is included, it'll use the 4-arg version, if it's not included, it'll call the three-arg version, which in turn just puts in an empty string for data calling the 4-arg version
