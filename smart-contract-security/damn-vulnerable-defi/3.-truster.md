# 3. Truster

#### Objective

A new pool has launched that is offering flash loans of DVT tokens for free. The pool holds 1 million DVT tokens. You have nothing.

Take all tokens out of the pool. If possible, in a single transaction.

#### Approach

The pool only has 1 function, flashLoan()

We notice:

* balances are checked against the token contract
* there is a nonReentrant modifier
* `target.funtionCall(data)`

{% hint style="info" %}
Code for [Address.functionCall](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/Address.sol):

<pre class="language-solidity"><code class="lang-solidity"><strong>require(address(this).balance >= value, "Address: insufficient balance for call");
</strong>require(isContract(target), "Address: call to non-contract");(bool success, bytes memory returndata) = target.call{value: value}(data);
return verifyCallResult(success, returndata, errorMessage);
</code></pre>
{% endhint %}

* this means that `target` must be a contract
* trusterLenderPool contract will execute `target.call{value: value}(data);` using its own context.
* In short, we can use target.functionCall to approve allowances from the pool to the attacker; thereby draining the pool.

**Solution**

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (357).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* since target accepts bytes data as a parameter, we must pass the approve function together with its parameters as data into it. this is done via abi.encondeWithSignature
* attacker calls the flashloan function, with said payload -> allowances would be approved
* attacker than calls token contract to drain the pool, utilising the allowances granted earlier.&#x20;
